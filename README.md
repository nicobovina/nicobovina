I'm a psychologist who programs. A couple of years ago I studied computer's science in ARG.<br>
I <b>love algorithms</b>. They simplify our lives (at least they try).<br>
Now I'm improving my skills in JavaScript, but learning data science is on my bucket list.<br><br>
My <i>values</i>: <b>learn</b> & <b>live</b>.
