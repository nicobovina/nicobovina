I'm a Fullstack web developer. A couple of years ago I studied computer science in ARG.<br>
I <b>love algorithms</b>. They simplify our lives (at least they try).<br>
Also, I am a psychologist. That allowed me to increase my soft skills and take my job seriously.
My <i>values</i>: <b>learn</b> & <b>live</b>.
